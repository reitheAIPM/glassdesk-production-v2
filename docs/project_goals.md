## AI AGENT GUIDELINES (DECISION MAKING)

### WHEN MAKING DECISIONS:
1. **Prioritize Privacy** - Never compromise user data security
2. **Focus on Simplicity** - Complex features should wait for later phases
3. **Think User-First** - Every feature should solve a real user problem
4. **Maintain Quality** - Better to do fewer things well than many things poorly

### WHEN ADDING FEATURES:
- **Ask**: "Does this help the user understand what they accomplished or need to do next?"
- **Consider**: "Is this essential for the MVP or can it wait?"
- **Validate**: "Will this improve the core user experience?"

## Integration Strategy
- Leverage existing AI capabilities in Gmail (e.g., Google Gemini), Zoom, and Asana to pull data and summaries, reducing development costs.
- Focus on pulling data based on specific criteria like keywords, date ranges, or using existing AI summaries.

### AI Capabilities
- **Data Summarization**: Use NLP techniques to extract key information from emails, meeting notes, and project updates.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Utilize historical data to predict future trends or outcomes for project management and prioritization.

### User Interface
- Start with a simple interface, possibly a pop-up assistant similar to Clippy, to provide a friendly and accessible user experience.
- Evolve the interface over time based on user feedback and functionality refinement.

### Data Privacy and Security
- Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information.
- Use OAuth for authentication and authorization when integrating with third-party services.
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR or CCPA, depending on the target audience.

### Next Steps
- **OAuth Implementation**: Set up Google Cloud Console credentials
- **Production Deployment**: Deploy to Railway with real environment variables
- **Real API Integration**: Replace mock data with live API calls
- **User Testing**: Gather feedback on real-world usage
- **Feature Enhancement**: Add advanced AI capabilities based on user needs

### Project Status Update
- All foundational backend, mock data, and AI query systems were built and tested
- Project is in alignment: mock data flows, data processor, AI interface, enhanced sandbox, and test API routes are all implemented and tested
- **Ready for OAuth integration** - next step is Google Cloud Console setup
