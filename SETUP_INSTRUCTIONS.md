# GlassDesk Setup Instructions

## ✅ Completed Steps

1. **✅ Clean Repository Created**: All files have been copied to a clean directory with no secret exposure
2. **✅ Dependency Conflicts Fixed**: 
   - Updated httpx to >=0.27.0 for chromadb compatibility
   - Pinned pydantic to v1 for LangChain compatibility
   - Updated chromadb to stable version 0.4.15
3. **✅ Git Repository Initialized**: Clean commit with no secrets in history
4. **✅ Gmail Integration Included**: Gmail routes and integration are ready

## 🔄 Next Steps (User Action Required)

### 1. **GitHub Repository Setup**

The remote is currently set to a placeholder. Update it with your actual repository:

```bash
# Remove placeholder remote
git remote remove origin

# Add your actual GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/glassdesk-production-v2.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

### 2. **Railway Deployment**

Your Railway deployment should automatically detect the new push and rebuild:

```bash
# Check Railway status
railway status

# If needed, force redeploy
railway redeploy

# Monitor logs
railway logs
```

### 3. **Environment Variables (Already Set)**

Your Railway environment variables should already be configured:
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET  
- GOOGLE_DESKTOP_CLIENT_ID
- GOOGLE_DESKTOP_CLIENT_SECRET
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- SECRET_KEY
- DATABASE_URL (auto-configured by Railway)

### 4. **Test Deployment**

Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- Health Check: https://glassdesk-production.up.railway.app/health
- OAuth Flow: https://glassdesk-production.up.railway.app/auth/google/login
- API Docs: https://glassdesk-production.up.railway.app/docs

## 🐛 **Fixed Issues**

1. **Dependency Conflicts**: httpx and pydantic version conflicts resolved
2. **Secret Exposure**: All secrets replaced with placeholders
3. **Git History**: Clean repository with no sensitive data
4. **Railway Builds**: Dependencies aligned for successful deployment
